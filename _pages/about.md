I am a Research Scientist in the Marine Corps and Defense Workforce Program in the Resources and Force Readiness Division of CNA.  My primary research interests include labor economics and the economics of education with work on K-12 teacher tenure, predictive models of teacher performance, returns to university STEM programs, and major league baseball aging curves.  I am particularly interested in research on teacher selection and incentives to maximize student outcomes.
